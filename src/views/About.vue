      Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series
      created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The show aired on AMC from January
      20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of
      62 episodes. It was set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and tells
      the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified,
      and dispirited high school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a
      recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of
      crime, partnering with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), by
      producing and distributing crystal meth to secure his family's financial
      future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal
      underworld. According to Gilligan, the title is a Southern colloquialism
      meaning "to raise hell".[8] Among the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ
      Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy Brandt and
      Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA
      agent. Others include Bob Odenkirk as White's and Pinkman's sleazy lawyer
      Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike
      Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final
      season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd Alquist,
      and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive
      secretly managing Walter's global meth sales for her company. Breaking
      Bad's first season received generally positive reviews, while the rest of
      its run received universal acclaim. Since its conclusion, the show has
      been lauded by critics as one of the greatest television series of all
      time.[9] It had fair viewership in its first three seasons, but the fourth
      and fifth seasons saw a moderate rise in viewership when it was made
      available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere. Viewership
      increased more drastically upon the premiere of the second half of the
      fifth season in 2013. By the time that the series finale aired, it was
      among the most-watched cable shows on American television. The show
      received numerous awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards, eight
      Satellite Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Peabody Awards, two
      Critics' Choice Awards, and four Television Critics Association Awards.
      Cranston won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a
      Drama Series four times, while Aaron Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for
      Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series three times; Anna Gunn won
      the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama
      Series twice. In 2013, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as
      the most critically acclaimed show of all-time.[10] Better Call Saul, a
      prequel series featuring Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito reprising their
      Breaking Bad roles, debuted on AMC on February 8, 2015, and has been
      renewed for a final sixth season. The sequel film El Camino: A Breaking
      Bad Movie starring Aaron Paul was released on Netflix and in theaters on
      October 11, 2019.[11]
